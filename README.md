# Jekyll-Bootstrap

The quickest way to start and publish your Jekyll powered blog. 100% compatible with GitHub pages

## Usage

For all usage and documentation please see: <http://jekyllbootstrap.com>

## Version

0.3.0 - stable and versioned using [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

**NOTE:** 0.3.0 introduces a new theme which is not backwards compatible in the sense it won't _look_ like the old version.
However, the actual API has not changed at all.
You might want to run 0.3.0 in a branch to make sure you are ok with the theme design changes.

## Contributing 

This repository tracks 2 projects:

- **Jekyll-Bootstrap Framework.**  
  The framework for which users should clone and build their blog on top of is available in the master branch.
  
  To contribute to the framework please make sure to checkout your branch based on `jb-development`!!
  This is very important as it allows me to accept your pull request without having to publish a public version release.
  
  Small, atomic Features, bugs, etc.   
  Use the `jb-development` branch but note it will likely change fast as pull requests are accepted.   
  Please rebase as often as possible when working.   
  Work on small, atomic features/bugs to avoid upstream commits affecting/breaking your development work.
  
  For Big Features or major API extensions/edits:   
  This is the one case where I'll accept pull-requests based off the master branch.
  This allows you to work in isolation but it means I'll have to manually merge your work into the next public release.
  Translation : it might take a bit longer so please be patient! (but sincerely thank you).
 
- **Jekyll-Bootstrap Documentation Website.**    
  The documentation website at <http://jekyllbootstrap.com> is maintained in the gh-pages branch.
  Please fork and contribute documentation additions to this branch only.

The master and gh-pages branch do not share the same ancestry. Please treat them as completely separate git repositories!

# The Plain v3.0

The Plain is a minimalist Jekyll theme, designed to focus on writing that really matters to you and your audience. Everything else is just a distraction. Nothing more other than useful and understandable information sharing. I have made a final update to this theme. No Google web font, no JS, and no fancy thing. This theme is suit best for personal blog type, but not limited to. P/S: This theme is originally inspired from Leonard Lamprecht's original [Jekyll theme](https://github.com/leo/leo.github.io) (thanks!).
