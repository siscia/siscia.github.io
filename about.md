I am a tech freelancer.

I work in the intersection between business and technology.

My approach to any problem is to gain solid knowledge about the problem domain, then start to iterate with fast-to-test solution.

Finally, when everything is settled I finish up my work cleaning up and smooth any rough edge.

Right now I am working mainly on IoT and distributed, fault tolerant systems.
